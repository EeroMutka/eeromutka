      <description>Quick test: Can you spot the bug in the following C++ code?
void spawn_explosion(GameWorld* world, const Vector3&amp;amp; explode_at, float size){for (int i = world-&amp;gt;entities.count - 1; i &amp;gt;= 0; i--){if (length(world-&amp;gt;entities[i].position - explode_at) &amp;lt; size){// This unlucky fellow was too close to the explosionarray_remove(&amp;amp;world-&amp;gt;entities, i);}}// spawn some epic particles, etc...} It&amp;rsquo;s tricky, because by itself, there is no bug.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Rug Racers: Ultimate&amp;rdquo; is an arcade flying-carpet racing game where you race against your friend on a physical carpet. I was the lead programmer responsible for making the engine, the input system and a lot of the gameplay code, and I also did a lot of game design. We were a 6-person team and made the game during a 10 week long school course. We won 2 awards at Gotland Game Conference, as well as got nominated at Swedish Game Awards!</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Through a game-jam friend, I got the opportunity to work on &amp;ldquo;Mortal Shell&amp;rdquo; as a gameplay programmer and designer. It&amp;rsquo;s a soulslike action-RPG set in a shattered world where your skill and resilience is tested. Since release, the game has sold over 500 000 copies worldwide, and received a metacritic score of 76.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning how to build game development and 3D tools using code. While this has been really fun, it&amp;rsquo;s also sometimes frustrating due to the oddities of C++: Header files, order dependent declarations, long compile times, weird casting rules, the list goes on. The following is a blog-style entry about my process of making a programming language prototype, and what I sent as my work sample for the Futuregames school in Stockholm.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rocket League is the best, no one can deny that. But what if you could also play volleyball in it? I made that possible! (among with other mods)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bonus: Art portfolio</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked art. I went to an art high school and was doing a lot of 3D art at the time. I learned about composition, lighting, 3D techniques and how to work with programs like Blender, Substance Painter &amp;amp; Designer, Zbrush and Unreal. I was on my way to becoming a game artist! Then I got really hooked with programming and it has become my main focus.
I still take a lot of the knowledge with me to my programming projects.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Game jams really got me hooked into game development when I first started out. I&amp;rsquo;ve participated in many game jams, both alone as well as in teams. Here are some fun highlights!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
