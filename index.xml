      <description>Quick test: Can you spot the bug in the following C++ code?
void spawn_explosion(GameWorld* world, const Vector3&amp;amp; center, float radius){spawn_epic_particles(center);play_explosion_sound(center);// Destroy entities that are too close to the explosionfor (int i = world-&amp;gt;entities.count - 1; i &amp;gt;= 0; i--){if (length(world-&amp;gt;entities[i].position - center) &amp;lt; radius){array_remove(&amp;amp;world-&amp;gt;entities, i);}}} It&amp;rsquo;s tricky, because by itself, there is no bug. But now consider the following:</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Rug Racers: Ultimate&amp;rdquo; is an arcade flying-carpet racing game where you race against your friend on a physical carpet. I was the lead programmer responsible for making the engine, the input system and a lot of the gameplay code, and I also did a lot of game design. We were a 6-person team and made the game during a 10 week long school course. We won 2 awards at Gotland Game Conference, as well as got nominated at Swedish Game Awards!</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Through a game-jam friend, I got the opportunity to work on &amp;ldquo;Mortal Shell&amp;rdquo; as a gameplay programmer and designer. It&amp;rsquo;s a soulslike action-RPG set in a shattered world where your skill and resilience is tested. Since release, the game has sold over 500 000 copies worldwide, and received a metacritic score of 76.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning how to build game development and 3D tools using code. While this has been really fun, it&amp;rsquo;s also sometimes frustrating due to the oddities of C++: Header files, order dependent declarations, long compile times, weird casting rules, the list goes on. The following is a blog-style entry about my process of making a programming language prototype, and what I sent as my work sample for the Futuregames school in Stockholm.</description>

      <description>Recently I started a new project of making a real-time 3D editor, using CSG (constructive solid geometry). I didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly know how CSG worked before, so I looked into some articles. I learned some cool things, such as what the half-edge data structure is. Previously, it had been a big mystery to me how you would actually implement a 3d modeling operation such as extrusion, bevel, or inserting edge loops, but this small idea really opened things up for me.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Game jams really got me hooked into game development when I first started out. I&amp;rsquo;ve participated in many game jams, both alone as well as in teams. Here are some fun highlights!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
