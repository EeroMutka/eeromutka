    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Through a game-jam friend, I got the opportunity to work on &ldquo;Mortal Shell&rdquo; as a gameplay programmer and designer. It&rsquo;s a soulslike action-RPG set in a shattered world where your skill and resilience is tested. Since release, the game has sold over 500 000 copies worldwide, and received a metacritic score of 76.</p>

</div>

<p>I was sort of a generalist on the team, implementing and refining a lot of gameplay elements and environmental objects using Unreal Engine 4&rsquo;s blueprints. I would do a lot of polishing and bugfixing in many different areas of the game. I might have gotten a task, such as &ldquo;The cathedral level needs a gate that gets unlocked by finding 3 different levers.&rdquo; I would then do my best to make it as polished as possible, with animation curves, utilizing existing sounds and particles and passing around ideas with the team. The core team was pretty small with only 15 people, so I got quite a bit of artistic freedom with the tasks.</p>
<p>An example of a mechanic I made is the big radial waves that the final boss in the game creates, as seen in the video (4:18)

</p>
<p>Unless you dash through the wave or turn into stone as in the video, you get knocked down by it. I&rsquo;m using a sine-wave as the function to calculate the height of the wave, in both the shader to offset the vertices and to generate the mask for switching to a different wave texture, as well as in the gameplay code to check if the player has been in the wave for long enough to get knocked down. If you get knocked down (in the video after the first wave), an animation montage plays out that I combined from multiple animations where you roll on the water and rise back up. I was really happy with how it felt to play!</p>
<p>I also need to mention the bear trap. When I joined the project, you could randomly get bitten by an almost invisible bear trap. They felt bad and I talked to the director about it. He agreed and was contemplating removing them, but I saw potential and took on the task to remake them and balance them in the level so they feel fair. The goal is to troll the player a little, and to make them keep track of another danger that lurks in the hostile world. It&rsquo;s a risky mechanic that people will hate, but hopefully still think: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so dumb&rdquo;, while they wait for the teeth to open again.</p>

</div>

<p>I made the trap larger and tweaked their locations to be more visible in the level and added a subtle spotlight to them. I improved the animation transitions and the transform snapping, as it previously felt like you would get teleported in a disorienting way. I made the trap give very little damage so you&rsquo;d most likely not die to it if you get bitten (though enemies could still attack you while trapped). As a fun bonus, I made it so that enemies can also get bit so you can lure them into traps if you want. So we kept the bear trap, and I don&rsquo;t feel bad for the evil I&rsquo;ve caused :)</p><ul class="pa0">
