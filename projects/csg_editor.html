			<i>2D prototype I made to try out the mesh boolean algorithm before porting it to 3D</i><br><br>
			
			<p>The motivation for this project came from ideas I had for a new kind of 3D modeling tool. Having CSG / mesh boolean operations as the basic editing operations in a 3D editor seemed like a good idea, as they're intuitive and they let you easily compose simple shapes into more complicated designs. The sculpting tools of <a href="https://youtu.be/v27LZivpffQ">Dreams</a> were a big inspiration to me, and their idea of <a href="https://youtu.be/DpSWMQgBpHI">a sensitive tool</a>.</p>

			<p>The approach Dreams uses for implementing adding/cutting operations is to use signed distance functions. SDFs are nice and simple to implement, but when the list of shapes gets large, rendering it naively with ray marching would be too expensive to do in real time. Dreams has an advanced system to hierarchically convert from the SDFs into point clouds using compute shaders and a special rendering pipeline to draw them. However, I wanted to stay in the realm of triangle meshes, as that's what game engines typically work with and my goal wasn't to have the painterly art style of Dreams which would require very special rendering techniques.</p>

			<p>One option would be to convert from an SDF into a triangle mesh using marching cubes, dual contoring, or similar. Alex Evans goes through various approaches for this in his <a href="https://youtu.be/u9KNtnCZDMI">Dreams R&D talk</a>. The problem is that the resulting mesh needs to be really dense to keep the geometric detail, making it slow to generate and to render. The generation time is also linearly proportional to the SDF complexity, so over time editing would become slower and slower. My goal is to have a very fast algorithm to let the users edit shapes in real-time and see the boolean results immediately (no matter how long they work on their model), so meshing SDFs didn't seem like the best alternative.</p>

			<p>The most promising path seemed to be 3D mesh boolean & CSG algorithms. I braced myself assuming it would be quite hard as they have a reputation of being fragile in most 3D software. Especially in edge cases with shapes barely touching, things often break. There are some libraries that can perform mesh booleans robustly, but they seemed too slow for real-time editing, so I chose to dive deeper into this problem myself. I was also just curious!</p>
			
			<h2>But there were obstacles...</h2>
			
			<p>I learned that most mesh boolean algorithms follow a similar structure: first, cut each face in mesh A by each face in mesh B and vice versa, then for each face determine if it's inside mesh A and/or mesh B, and based on that and the current boolean op (subtract / union / intersect), either delete the face, keep it, or flip it. Seems relatively easy! But what happens if a face in mesh A and a face in mesh B are overlapping and sharing the same plane? This would add a third case to the code that'd need manual handling. Sure enough, that can be done, for example by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9410209">Simulating Simplicity</a>. Though actually, it would likely never occur in practice, because of the reality of floating point math. Floats can't represent all the numbers we want exactly; they always round to the nearest representable floating point value. These small errors can lead to invalid results near edge cases. A simple "X > 0" comparison somewhere might end up giving the wrong truth value if X is some math expression that results in a value very close to zero. This is the real problem.</p>
			
			<p>Many have tried to combat these problems by putting tiny thresholds, like 0.001, in the conditions (myself included), but it seems that no-one has really succeeded in making a robust algorithm this way. I could always find some way to break the algorithm.</p>

			<i>Box & box intersection using floats. Seems quite robust in the video still!</i><br><br>
			
			<p>Aside: during my initial reseach, I also learned about the half-edge data structure, which ended up being very handy. It's like a web of linked lists of mesh data, where inserting geometry, deleting and adding cuts becomes trivial. It has stayed in one form or another throughout all my experiments.</p>
			
			<p>But alright, how can we get rid of the floating point issues? One idea is to do all the math on rational numbers that are stored as two 64-bit integers X and Y that encode the value X / Y. For example, the product C = A*B could be represented as Cx = Ax*Bx and Cy = Ay*By. This would be perfectly robust, right? The issue is that when adding or multiplying two numbers, the number of bits required for storing the new number is higher than that of the original numbers. When performing a cut, new intermediate vertices would be created, where the number of bits required for storing them is higher than for the original vertices. Imagine that the user wants to keep adding boolean operations consecutively: the required number of bits to represent the vertex coordinates would keep growing - quadratically! The 64-bit integer range would run out and we'd need to start using dynamically-sized integers, and the amount of CPU work would grow and become unfeasible quite quickly. We could limit the growth by reducing the precision and quantizing the coefficients back to fixed-size integers as a final step of the algorithm, but that could introduce slight errors in the mesh which could break subsequent operations.</p>
			
			<h2>The solution</h2>
			
			<iframe allow="fullscreen;" width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kCL9DabX_wk""></iframe>
			
			<p>I found some promising papers: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02486">Fast Exact Booleans for Iterated CSG using Octree-Embedded BSPs</a> and <a href="https://www.vci.rwth-aachen.de/publication/03339/">EMBER: Exact Mesh Booleans via Efficient & Robust Local Arrangements</a> by the same authors. Interestingly, the papers use integer arithmetic, but manage to avoid the problem I described above. The idea is to represent all geometry using planes, where a plane is defined as the four fixed-size integer coefficients `A, B, C, D` of the plane equation `Ax + By + Cz + D = 0`. Edges are represented as the intersection of two planes, points by the intersection of three planes, and (convex) polygons by a plane and a list of edge planes. A nice property of boolean operations is that the result of a boolean is fully made up of polygons from either of its input meshes, possibly flipped or cut by each other's planes. That means it's possible to represent the boolean result mesh using only the original planes from the two input meshes. That's perfect, as we can then apply as many boolean operations as we want without ever growing the bit complexity or requiring quantization!</p>

			<p>I took inspiration from the two papers and extended the ideas to handle meshes with self-intersections, as opposed to requiring 2 well-formed input meshes at a time. This means that fun things like <a href="https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/228336/correct-way-to-extrude-inward-intrude">Sketchup-style extrusions</a> are allowed, and it will also allow for robustly moving/rotating/scaling intermediate results and quantizing vertices, as the self-intersections introduced by these operations are resolved by the algorithm.</p>

			<i>At 0:25, I draw the mesh to go through itself, which correctly results in a hole. Also see the first video at the top of this page at 0:16 for 3D self-intersection resolving.</i>
			
			<p>For resolving self-intersections, I took inspiration from the paper <a href="https://users.cs.utah.edu/~ladislav/jacobson13robust/jacobson13robust.html">Robust Inside-Outside Segmentation using Generalized Winding Numbers</a>. The paper uses tetrahedral meshes to subdivide the space into sections, but I decided to use BSP trees as they seemed to fit plane-based geometry better. Once the space is subdivided into sections, I build a graph of links on the BSP from each BSP cell to its neighbours, and to each face that is on its borders. Then, I flood-fill the "insideness" value from each BSP cell to its neighbours, using faces on the cell borders to either increment or decrement the insideness value. Finally, the output faces are built out of the input faces for where the insideness crosses the 0 boundary. I made this all run on a separate thread so that the user-facing UI would always stay snappy. If the computation takes more than 1 frame, the rendered mesh will just lag slightly behind the wireframe. </p>
			
			<p>The project is still in its early stages, and as I've finally gotten the boolean algorithm to a good state, I'm moving my focus towards building the modeling tools and the editor itself. Stay tuned for more!</p>
