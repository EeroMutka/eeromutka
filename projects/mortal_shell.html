			<p>Mortal Shell is a soulslike action-RPG for PC and consoles. I worked on the game as a gameplay programmer as part of a 15-person team.</p>

			<p>My role as a gameplay programmer was to implement and refine gameplay mechanics, interactable objects and enemy/boss interactions, and of course to fix bugs. I mainly worked inside UE4's blueprints, building gameplay logic and connecting effects like sounds, particle effects and animations together. A lot of my work had to do with timing and curves; I often used UE4's blueprint timelines for making the mechanics feel juicy. The team was relatively small, and I was given a lot of artistic freedom for the design and implementation of mechanics.</p>

			<i>See 4:18 for the radial wave attack</i><br>

			<p>An example of a mechanic I made is the big radial waves that the final boss creates when it slams into the water (see 4:18 in the above video). A tesselated plane is spawned with a material using a sine function of time and distance to calculate a vertex offset and opacity. The wave is supposed to knock the player down on impact except if they dash through it or turn into stone form. To check for overlap, I copied the wave function from the material into the wave blueprint so that they match, and compute it at the player location. If the player is in a wave for some small duration, they get knocked down (see see 5:14 in the video). An animation montage I composed is played where the player rolls on the water and rises back up. A foam particle system is also enabled when the player is in a wave.</p>
			
			<p>For the final boss, I also implemented the whirlpool phase (at 7:13 in the video), the slam attack (at 2:05) and beak attack (at 2:10) and worked on the boss in general. A list of some other things I worked on includes the teleporters, levers and the elevator in the cathedral level, gates, various attacks for the wraith enemies, the ballistazooka ability, the brigand enemy AI, the Gorf NPC, the frog enemies, bear traps, the lute, the glands, level transitions, and the wormfish.</p>
