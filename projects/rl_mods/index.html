<p>I had an idea to make a volleyball game mode for Rocket League, so I learned how to do it. There were only a few tutorials at the time, and half the techniques didn&rsquo;t work. You couldn&rsquo;t add a box CSG-brush to the level, of course not; you had to add a cylinder and drag its vertices to make it practically into a box. It was all guesswork and experimenting.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely I figured it out. My volleyball map went through many iterations, but in the end it became a success with over 130k downloads! <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=916532343">Link to the workshop page</a>

<h2 id="the-modding-scene">The modding scene</h2>
<p>It was July 5th of 2017, the 2nd anniversary of Rocket League. Everyone was excited about the new update with new cars, new map and a new commentator voice line saying &ldquo;What a save!&rdquo; in the most annoying way. But there was one thing that no-one expected: all collisions were also suddenly broken in all custom maps! No-one could figure out what happened or how to fix it. The entire mapping community went to a halt for months, as what fun is it if you can just fly through everything?</p>
<p>One day I was messing around with UDK and the game files, as I finally figured out the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueMods/comments/6vs9gw/collisions_on_custom_maps_are_finally_fixed_the/">solution</a>! It had to do with the way options didn&rsquo;t get saved into the map files unless they differed from the defaults that the developers tinkered with, and I have a hunch that if I didn&rsquo;t figure it out, it might still be an unsolved mystery.</p>
<p>Another one of my breakthroughs was when I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueMods/comments/6uc8lp/how_to_access_any_ingame_asset_for_mapping_rl/">figured out</a> how to put any asset from the game into your custom maps. This immediately improved the visual quality of mods tremendously, as previously the art tools with custom maps were very limited. For example, most of the materials from my volleyball map are reusing in-game assets.</p>
<p>I made a few other maps as well like the sumo battle arena mod:

</div>
</p>
<p>It was just really fun to find new map making techniques to use in my maps and to share them with other mappers. The game was really popular, but it was only a handful of us making maps. I once made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g4wagWHXDp2n-fJ6_DrnlRG8XaZ6VLJAZ3zgDykga1Q/edit#heading=h.qovu4ug0vowi">tips &amp; tricks guide</a> for map making as well to document what I had learned.</p><ul class="pa0">
