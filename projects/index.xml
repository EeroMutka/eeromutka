      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rocket League is super fun, but what if you could also play volleyball in it? I made that possible! (among with other mods)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked making art. I went to an art high school and was doing a lot of 3D art at the time. I learned about composition, lighting, 3D techniques and how to work with programs like Blender, Substance Painter &amp;amp; Designer, Zbrush and Unreal. I was on my way to becoming a game artist! Then I got really hooked with programming and it has since become my main focus.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made a small programming language for game programming, and as a way to learn more about how compilers work. Here I describe my process of creating it and what is required to take a text file and to turn it into an executable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had lots of ideas floating around for a new kind of 3D level design / art tool that would be fun to use. This led me to learning about CSG and how it can be really tricky. Here I&amp;rsquo;ve documented the start of my journey to building this editor and the challenges I faced.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Game jams really got me hooked into game development when I first started out. I&amp;rsquo;ve participated in many game jams, both alone as well as in teams. Here are some fun highlights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Through a game-jam friend, I got the opportunity to work on &amp;ldquo;Mortal Shell&amp;rdquo; as a gameplay programmer and designer. It&amp;rsquo;s a soulslike action-RPG set in a shattered world where your skill and resilience is tested. Since release, the game has sold over 500 000 copies worldwide, and received a metacritic score of 76.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Real time physically-based renderer &amp; GI</title>

      <guid>http://eeromutka.github.io/projects/renderer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project was to combine all my learnings of shader and graphics programming into one unified renderer. I wanted to implement modern rendering techniques and add some of my own experiments on top, and to improve my understanding of Vulkan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Rug Racers: Ultimate&amp;rdquo; is an arcade flying-carpet racing game where you race against your friend on a physical carpet. I was the lead programmer responsible for making the core systems and a lot of the gameplay code, and I also did a lot of game design. We were a 6-person team and made the game during a 10 week long school course. The game won 2 awards at Gotland Game Conference, as well as got nominated at Swedish Game Awards!</description>
