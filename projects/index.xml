      <description>&lt;p&gt;Through a game-jam friend, I got the opportunity to work on &amp;ldquo;Mortal Shell&amp;rdquo; as a gameplay programmer and designer. It&amp;rsquo;s a soulslike action-RPG set in a shattered world where your skill and resilience is tested. Since release, the game has sold over 500 000 copies worldwide, and received a metacritic score of 76.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Game jams really got me hooked into game development when I first started out. I&amp;rsquo;ve participated in many game jams, both alone as well as in teams. Here are some highlights!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Rug Racers: Ultimate&amp;rdquo; is an arcade flying-carpet racing game where you race against your friend on a physical carpet. I was the lead programmer responsible for making the engine, the input system and a lot of the gameplay code, and I also did a lot of game design. We were a 6-person team and made the game during a 10 week long school course. We won 2 awards at Gotland Game Conference, as well as got nominated at Swedish Game Awards!</description>
